# NestJS  Online Payment Integration with Factory Pattern

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to **integrate online payments** in a **NestJS application** using the **Factory Pattern**, structured within a robust **Hexagonal Architecture**.

It serves as a hands-on guide to building a modular and scalable payment system that supports multiple payment gateways (e.g., **eSewa**, **Khalti**). The project is being documented through a detailed multi-part blog series to help developers adopt best practices and clean architecture in real-world NestJS applications.

Whether you're new to Hexagonal Architecture or looking to streamline payment integrations, this repository will provide a solid foundation to build on.

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```

## Running the Application
### Development
```sh
npm run start
```
### Production
```sh
npm run build && npm run start:prod
```


## Seeding the Database
This project includes a **seeding feature** to populate the database with initial data. Run the following command to seed the database:
```sh
npm run seed
```

## Database Migrations
This project includes **TypeORM migration** support for database schema changes.
- **Generate a new migration**:
  ```sh
  npm run migration:generate
  ```
- **Run pending migrations**:
  ```sh
  npm run migration:run
  ```
## üìù Blog Series

This project is supported by a **multi-part blog series** that walks through the concepts and implementation of **Hexagonal Architecture in NestJS**, with a focus on **online payment integration** using the **Factory Pattern**.



üîî Stay tuned! More parts will be added as the series progresses.
